#  OpenFighter — Open-Source Experimental Fighter Aircraft

**OpenFighter** is an open-source initiative to collaboratively design a complete fighter aircraft platform — including airframe, propulsion, avionics, sensors, and simulation systems — for research, education, and experimentation only.

This is a non-military, non-commercial, and non-operational project.

---

## Purpose

This project aims to:
- Explore the full design process of a modern fighter aircraft in an open and collaborative way
- Provide a public platform for learning and experimentation in aerospace engineering
- Build detailed, modular documentation and simulations of key subsystems
- Encourage innovation in open-source aerospace design

---

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into modules. Contributions are welcome in any of the following areas:

- `/airframe/` — Conceptual design, 3D models, aerodynamics
- `/engine/` — Turbine concepts, thermodynamic cycles, mockups
- `/avionics/` — Control systems, navigation, embedded electronics
- `/sensors/` — Radar, IRST, and other simulated sensor systems
- `/sim/` — Flight simulation environments (JSBSim, FlightGear, Unreal, etc.)
- `/docs/` — Technical documentation and educational materials

---

## Contribution Guidelines

- All contributions must respect the project's peaceful, educational purpose
- Real-world classified or restricted information is strictly prohibited
- Contributors must comply with export laws in their own countries
- Speculative or simplified designs are acceptable — this is not an industrial-grade program
